Attach the project to the Git and generate Readme of experiment 1.2.1



**index.js**


Importing the 'fs' Module: The code starts by importing the 'fs' (file system) module, which is used to read data from a JSON file.
calculateHRA Function: This function calculates the house rent allowance (HRA) for a given basic salary. It assumes that HRA is 20% of the basic salary.
calculateDA Function: This function calculates the dearness allowance (DA) for a given basic salary. It assumes that DA is 10% of the basic salary.
calculateGrossSalary Function: This function calculates the gross salary by adding the basic salary, HRA (calculated using calculateHRA), and DA (calculated using calculateDA).
main Function: The 'main' function is defined. Inside this function, the code reads data from a JSON file named 'data.json' using the 'fs' module's readFile function. It expects the data to be in UTF-8 encoding.



**data.json**



This data can be used as input for the JavaScript code you provided earlier to calculate and display the gross salary, house rent allowance (HRA), and dearness allowance (DA) for each of these employees based on their respective basic salaries. The code reads this data from a 'data.json' file and performs the calculations.
